## Description


Comprehensive reference information for the world's languages, especially the lesser known languages

This dataset is licensed under a CC-BY-4.0 license

Available online at https://glottolog.org

### Parameters
In addition to the langoid metadata in the [LanguageTable](cldf#table-languagescsv) this dataset contains values for the following [parameters](cldf#table-parameterscsv).

ID | Name | Description
--- | --- | ---
level | Level | Languoid level information needs to be interpreted in the context of the languoid's category. For languoids in 'non-genealogical trees' as described in https://glottolog.org/glottolog/glottologinformation the principles for determining language level languoids (see https://glottolog.org/glottolog/glottologinformation#principles) do not hold. Instead, in these cases, 'family' just means 'group of languoids', 'language' means 'languoid with extended metadata such as coordinates', and 'dialect' mean any type of 'sub-lect'.
category | Category | specifies a) if a family-level languoid represents a pseudo-family or not; b) for language-level languoids if it belongs to a pseudo-family or is a spoken, L1 language and c) for dialect-level languoids just mirrors the level. See CodeTable for a list of all assigned categories.
classification | Classification | Path from root of family to the languoid as slash-separated list of Glottocodes. A NULL value for classification means the languoid is a top-level genealogical unit, i.e. an isolate or a top-level family.
subclassification | Subclassification | Newick-formatted (sub)tree of descendants of the languoid, labeled by Glottocode
med | Most Extensive Description | The Most Extensive Description known for a given language. See CodeTable for a description of the valid values.
medovertime | Most Extensive Description over time | The Most Extensive Description for a given language over time.
aes | Agglomerated Endangerment Status | Language endangerment status compiled from various sources. See CodeTable for a description of the valid values.
